    Zooming in on a PDF can be helpful in many ways. It can make small or fine-print text easier to read,
    allow you to examine details more closely, and improve the readability of PDFs on small screens.
    Whether you're working with technical drawings, high-resolution images, or simply trying to read a
    document on your phone, zooming in on a PDF can enhance your experience and make it easier to view and work with the content.
